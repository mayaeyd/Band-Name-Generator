# Band-Name-Generator
Band Name Generator generates random band names when you click a button. It combines words from predefined lists to create unique names, offering instant creative inspiration with each click. It's a fun tool for musicians and anyone in need of a catchy band name.

Before running the index.js file, and after initializing npm, you'll have to run "npm i" in the bash terminal to install all of the node packages because the node modules folder couldn't be uploaded to Github.
